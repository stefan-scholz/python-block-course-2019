    "But before we come to data streams from the internet, we should first learn how data streams are defined in **Python**. In fact, to work with changing and large **data streams**, Python offers `Iterator`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our first session, we got to know a similarly named construct called `Iterable`. However, a `Iterable` is a **data structure**, e.g. list, tuple, dictionary, whereas `Iterator` is more like a **pointer** which points on certain data. Technically, a `Iterator` is an object that can be **iterated upon** with the help of the **methods** `__iter__()` and `__next__()`. Actually most iterables have a **build-in iterable** to access them. But you can also create your **own iterator object** which implements the two methods above. \n",
    "\n",
    "The big **advantage** about **iterators** is that with **large amounts** of **data** not all data need to be stored at once. For example, if we want to access all **numbers** from $0$ to $10^{50}$, we could try to store all numbers in a list, which will be for sure super **large**, but will probably not even fit into your **memory**. Instead we could use an **iterator** that creates each number after the other, such that only **one number** has to be **stored** at a time. This is a typical example where iterators are very helpful. \n",

But in comparision to REST APIs it requires much more **effort**, **time** and **tears**, because the desired information has **not** been **collected**, **cleaned** or **structured** by a provider. Still, if there is no suitable API available or it is unreasonable expensive, it is a good idea to implement a so-called **web scraper**. They are used to **extract data** from **webpages** automatically either with a bot or web crawler. Usually these webpages are scraped repeatedly to observe changes and generate data streams. \n",

As examples we will use the **webpages** behind the **news articles** from the [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) which we collected in the previous section.
