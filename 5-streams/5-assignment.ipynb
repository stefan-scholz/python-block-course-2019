    "In this fifth assignment you will walk through a small data project on data you are personally interested in. You will need to build your own data pipeline, stream and parse the data, and use object-oriented programming. In this way, you will wrap up everything what you have learned in this course. You can score up to 40 points in this assignment. Please submit your solutions inside this notebook in your repository on GitHub. The deadline for submission is on Friday, October 25, 09:59 am. You will get individual feedback in your repository."

    "There is a lot of interesting data in the internet. We want to give you the opportunity to explore data which is in your own personal interest. The only requirement on the data is that it fulfills the requirements of a data stream. So, if your data is not already completely available, but needs to be collected repeatedly, then it probably meets the requirements. If you do not have an idea on top of your mind, you can find an inspiration in the list of [APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) and [websites](https://dmoz-odp.org/). "
