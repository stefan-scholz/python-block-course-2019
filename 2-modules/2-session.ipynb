To make your code **deterministic**, you need to use a **function** `random.seed()` and give it an `Integer` or `String` as input. This seed is used to generate the next random number. All other drawn numbers are like a chain and build on the previous number. With the **function** `random.random()`, you can **draw numbers** in the **interval** of `[0,1)`.\n",
