    "During the maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic, she collided with an iceberg. Even though the Titanic was considered unsinkable, on April 15, 1912 she sank and tragically sweeped most of the passangers on board in their death. They only carried enough lifeboats for about half the number on board. Without a question, the sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. \n",
